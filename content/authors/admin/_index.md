      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am MESSADI Ikram, a Junior Data scientist & Researcher in Machine learning/Data Science. I am soon to be a Master's graduate in Data science. My research interests include computer vision, confidentiality and ethical AI and Deep learning applied to health. I am currently finishing a 6 months internship in IMT Nord Europe where I work on Deep learning applied on Time-series for muscle fatigue characterization.
